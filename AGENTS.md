# Purpose

This document exists for shortcomings — in the codebase, the model, or the tooling — that cause non-obvious failures. No architecture overviews, file trees, build commands, or anything an agent can figure out by reading the codebase. When you hit something that belongs here, first consider whether a code change could eliminate it and suggest that to the user. Only document it here if it can't be reasonably fixed.
