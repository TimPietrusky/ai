// run the following prompt when working the first time in a codebase that has no context yet

this is the first time that we work in this codebase, so lets create a shared context under "docs/context.md"

- scan the whole codebase
- find out how it works, which tech is used, how it is structured
- what is the project about?
- what is the high level architecture?
- what other aspects are important for first time contributors?

the purpose of this document is to enable devs and agents to work in the codebase, even without having never touched it
